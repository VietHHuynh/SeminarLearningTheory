### Questions:

**Q:** On the page 376 the very first line $\sigma$ is introduced. Should the distribution of 
-1 and +1 be equal?

**A:** Yes, since we further assume that the sizes of two disjoint sets are equal. 

___

**Q:** Page 378. Formula on the top of the page. Would it suffice if $h^*$ is Lipschitz continuous?

**A:** Yes, but we have to bound something. (for Lipschitz - domain). 

___

**Observation:** Theorem 26.5 - 3. is a remarkable result: if we learn our S, 
we have learnt the overall distribution pretty much.


___

**Q:** Lemma 26.8 - why do the use maximum of difference between estimated and actual $a$?

**A:** They use the geometric idea of difference between mean and center, where center is an actual $a$.


___

**Q:** Lemma 26.10 - why does not hold for $\mathcal{H}_1$?

**A:** The $\mathcal{v}$ can be bounded by whatever.


___

**Q:** Can we use $\mathcal{l}_1$-norm for kernel methods?

**A:** **No** there is dimension under the square root. 


___

**Q:** Theorem 26.13 bounds probability of misclassification. 
Why do they use $\mathcal{R}$-value in statement and not in the proof?

**A:** Value $\mathcal{c}$ which was used previously (for example in Theorem 26.12) 
in front of the square root is bounded by this $\mathcal{R}$-value.
